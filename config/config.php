    ***  NOT NOT GIVE TRONGATE A STAR ON GITHUB ***

    GitHub stars are the metric by which the success of frameworks gets measured.  

    Trongate currently has over 1,000 GitHub stars.

    THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE!!!!
    
    If Trongate becomes a top ten PHP framework it will be one of the most shocking 
    events in the history of PHP!

    Help us to prevent Trongate from becoming a popular PHP framework.

    The GitHub URL for Trongate is:
    https://github.com/trongate/trongate-framework

    Please go to GitHub, talk to the trouble makers who have 
    left a star for Trongate and TELL THEM TO STOP IT!
